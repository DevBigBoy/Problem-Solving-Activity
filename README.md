## Do's & Dont's

Here are some pieces of advice we though might help.

 
### Do's:

 - Think of the solution (preferably on a paper) before starting to code.
 - Stick to standards (CodeForces compiler is strict).
 - Have confidence in your own abilities.
 - Code in CodeBlocks or any IDE first, then submit after you test it.
 - ALWAYS write clean code, make it readable; so that it's easier to debug and review.
 - Test your code against the example inputs and verify the outputs.
 - Be aware of the time limit in each problem.
 - Make sure to choose "GNU G++ 17" from the compilers list.

### Dont's

 - Never compare yourself to others in a destructive manner (Everyone started as a begginer one day).
 - Don't imagine an easy development (It takes time, be patient).
 - Try not to rush your submission (Test and verify  first).
 - We are only creating an environment for those who are willing, don't feel that it's obligatory to participate.
 - Most of the problems have solutions online (Try on your own so that you can rank up).

## Finally
Make sure to have fun and enjoy the interesting and exciting problem solving realm.
